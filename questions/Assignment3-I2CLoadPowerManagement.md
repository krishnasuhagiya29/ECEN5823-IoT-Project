*Be sure to take measurements with logging disabled to ensure your logging logic is not impacting current/time measurements.*

*Please include screenshots of the profiler window detailing each current measurement captured.  See the file: Instructions to add screenshots in assignment.docx in the ECEN 5823 Student Public Folder.* 

1. What is the average current per period? (Remember, once you have measured your average current, average current is average current over all time. Average current doesnâ€™t carry with it the units of the timespan over which it was measured).
   Answer: 159.05 uA
